##### Requirements

  - Windows 7 / OS X 10.9 / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS <sup>1</sup>
  - Chrome / Safari / Firefox / IE 11+ <sup>2</sup>
  - Java 8
  - Eclipse Luna SR2 (4.4.2)+, Java EE edition. Eclipse Neon 4.6
    recommended <sup>3 </sup>
  - JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA 15+ Community/Ultimate 
  - Vaadin 8.0+

<sup>1</sup> In addition, libwebkitgtk 1.0 needs to be installed
(libwebkitgtk 3 not sufficient).  
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but other distributions known to work, as
long as libwebkitgtk 1.0 is available for Eclipse.

<sup>2</sup> Vaadin Designer makes use of your system browser to achieve
real WYSIWYG. Note that security settings (particularly on Windows / IE)
may in some instances interfere. IE8/9/10 not supported and results in
designer not loading.

<sup>3</sup> Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers preferred. Vaadin
Designer can be installed on other variants, but some update-site for
dependencies might be missing. See
the [FAQ](https://vaadin.com/designer/faq) for more details.  
Verified to work on STS 3.6.4.  
Vaadin Designer can be installed on older Luna versions, but prior to
SR2 there are serious bugs in Eclipse.

#### Limitations

Custom widgetsets not used when designing. Custom (project) components
and nested designs are shown as place holders when designing.

#### GridLayout column- and row-spanning

Limited support for GridLayout; no column- or row-spanning.

#### ClassResource not supported

The declarative format does not currently support ClassResource (e.g for
icons and images). The supported resources are: ThemeResource
(theme://), ExternalResource (http://), FileResource (file://) and (for
icons only) FontIcon (fonticon://).

#### Using theme from separate project not supported

Using a theme from another project (e.g Maven multi-module project) is
not supported.

      - The content for Grid, Table, Tree, TreeTable and MenuBar can be
        edited, and will appear when the application is run (unless
        replaced by java code).
      - Note the two important differences for 1.0 users:
          - When opening old designs, these components will appear empty
          - The pre-configured example content will actually end up in
            the design if you do not edit it.
      - The content can be edited in code-mode, or using the
        "Content"-property.
  - Improved Dark theme support
  - Improved GridLayout support
  - Copy&paste and drag&drop is now works with html snippets
  - Less external requirements (e.g JEE feature, Vaadin plug-in) =
    better compatibility

    preserved 
  - Properties re-ordered for better usability
  - Fixed multiple notorious error causes for "Could not retrieve
    controller for context path", "Failed to get component from
    mapper", "ConcurrentModificationException in ComponentModelMapper"
    and "No mapper contains the selected component".

long as libwebkitgtk 1.0 is available for Eclipse.

<sup>2</sup> Vaadin Designer makes use of your system browser to achieve
real WYSIWYG. Note that security settings (particularly on Windows / IE)
may in some instances interfere. IE8/9 not supported and results in
designer not loading.

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><sup>3</sup> Java version used to
run Eclipse - your project can still use any Java version supported by
Vaadin. Refer to Eclipse documentation for more information about how to
verify and change the version used by Eclipse (note that Eclipse might
not use your system default).</span>
